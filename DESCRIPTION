Description: This package helps with the development of critical phases of the 
    ecological niche modeling process in Maxent. It allows to calibrate models by
    creating and testing several candidate models. Handly options for producing 
    final models, evaluating them, and assesing extrapolation risks are also
    included as part of this package. Other functions help user to prepare data
    for ecological niche modeling, and further functions allow users to perform 
    post-modeling analyses.
