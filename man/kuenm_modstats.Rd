\title{Calculation of descriptive statistics of models}
\usage{
kuenm_modstats(sp.name, fmod.dir, format = "asc", project, statistics,
  replicated, proj.scenarios, ext.type, out.dir = "Final_Model_Stats")
}
\arguments{
\item{sp.name}{(character) name of the species. This name must be the one that appears as part
of the raster file of each model. If results are from Maxent, this is the name that
is in the first column of the csv containing species occurrence data (species) but changing spaces
(if there is any) by underscore.}

\item{fmod.dir}{(character) the  name of the folder in which final models are (e.g., the output
folder after using the \code{\link{kuenm_mod}}) function. It is important to have only the folders
containing the models in this directory. It can be only one folder or multiple folders containing models
for the same species, created with distinct parameter settings. If models were projected, and the
distinct types of extrapolation were used, the name of the folders contained in this directory should
include a pattern describing the type of extrapolation used (e.g., "EC" for extrapolation and
clamping in Maxent).}

\item{format}{(character) format of model raster files. Options are: "asc" or "tif"; default = "asc".}

\item{project}{(logical) if TRUE, it is assumed that models were projected to other scenarios.}

\item{statistics}{(character) vector of descriptive statistics to be calculated. Options include
med = median, mean, min = minimum, max = maximum, range, sd = stadard deviation, and se = standard error.
By default c("med", "min", "max", "range") are calculated, unless a character vector with the desired
statistics is provided.}

\item{replicated}{(logical) whether or not final models were created performing replicates.}

\item{proj.scenarios}{(character) valid if \code{project} = TRUE, vector of pattern(s) that identify
each projection area (scenario) to which models were projected.}

\item{ext.type}{(character) valid if \code{project} = TRUE, vector of pattern(s) to be searched in the
folders inside \code{fmod.dir} that identify the extrapolation type(s) of model projections. This pattern(s)
need to be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the name of the model folder name. For instance,
capital letter can be used to separate this pattern from the rest of the folder name (e.g., "EC" will be
the patter that denotes extrapolation and clamping in the folder named "M_0.1_F_l_set1_EC").}

\item{out.dir}{(character) name of the output directory to be created in which subdirectories
containing raster layers of model statistics will be written. Default = "Final_Model_Stats".}
}
\value{
Folders named Statistics or Statistics_("pattern" depending on the ext.type)
with all the raster layers of the descriptive statistics for models in \code{fmod.dir}.
Folders will be written inside \code{out.dir}.
}
\description{
kuenm_modstats calculates raster layers with some descriptive statistics of all
model replicates across multiple parameter settings. All of this, discriminating among models
transfered to distinct projection areas (scenarios).
}
\details{
Users must be specific when defining the patterns that the function will search for. This patterns
must be part of the model (raster layer) names so the function can locate each file without problems.
This function uses this system of work to avoid high demands of the RAM while perfomring these analyses.
