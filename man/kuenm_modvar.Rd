\title{Prediction variance comming from distinct sources in ENMs}
\usage{
kuenm_modvar(sp.name, fmod.dir, replicated, format = "asc", project,
  current, time.periods, emi.scenarios, clim.models, ext.type,
  split.length = 100, out.dir = "Variation_from_sources")
}
\arguments{
\item{sp.name}{(character) name of the species. This name must be the one that appears as part
of the raster file of each model repliate. If results are from Maxent, this is the name that
is in the first column of the csv containing species occurrence data (species) but ecxcluding spaces.}

\item{fmod.dir}{(character) the  name of the folder in which final models are (i.e., the output
folder after using the \code{\link{kuenm_mod}}) function.}

\item{replicated}{(logical) whether or not final models were created performing replicates.}

\item{format}{(character) format of model raster files. Options are: "asc" or "tif"; default = "asc".}

\item{project}{(logical) if TRUE, assumes that models were projected to other scenarios.
These scenarios can be current (projections in space), and/or future or past (projections in time).}

\item{current}{(character) pattern to look for when defining which is the scenario of current
projection. If not defined variance maps will be produced for the area of calibration, and if
any of \code{time.periods}, \code{clim.models}, or \code{emi.scenarios} exist, variace maps will
be produced for these layers as well.}

\item{time.periods}{(character or numeric) pattern to be searched when identifying models from
distinct time projections. If not defined it is assumed that one time period was considered.}

\item{emi.scenarios}{(character) pattern to be searched for identifying distinct emission
scenarios (e.g., RCP numbers). If not defined, it is
asumed that only one emission scenario was used. Therefore, this source of variation will not be
considered.}

\item{clim.models}{(character) names that identify climatic models used for project ENMs.
If not defined it is assumed that only one climate model was used. Therefore, this source of
variation will not be considered.}

\item{ext.type}{(character) valid if \code{project} = TRUE, vector of pattern(s) to be searched in the
folders inside \code{fmod.dir} that identify the extrapolation type(s) of model projections. This pattern(s)
need to be clearly distinguishable from the rest of the name of the model folder name. For instance,
capital letter can be used to separate this pattern from the rest of the folder name (e.g., "EC" will
be the patter that denotes extrapolation and clamping in the folder named "M_0.1_F_l_set1_EC").}

\item{split.length}{(numeric) limit number of models to be processed at the time. Bigger numbers
would demand more from the RAM. Default = 100.}

\item{out.dir}{(character) name of the output directory to be created in which subdirectories
containing raster layers of model variance will be written. Default = "Variation_from_sources".}
}
\value{
Folders named Variation or Variation_("pattern" depending on the ext.type) conatining
subdirectories named according to where/when models were projected. Iside these folder raster
layers of variance comming from distinct sources. All results will be written inside \code{out.dir}.
}
\description{
kuenm_modvar calculates the variance in model predictions distinguishing the
source from which this is comming. In this version potential sources of variation are:
replicates, parameterizations, general circulation models (GCMs), and emission scenarios.
The last two considered only when projections in time are performed.
}
\details{
If any of the potential sources of variation is equal to one (e.g., only one parameter, or
only one climate model), this source of variation will not be considered.

Users must be specific when defining the patterns that the function will search for. This patterns
must be part of the model (raster layer) names so the function can locate each file without problems.
This function uses this system of work to avoid high demands of the RAM while perfomring these analyses.
