\usage{
kuenm_mmop(G.var.dir, M.var.dir, sets.var, out.mop, percent = 10,
  comp.each = 2000, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{G.var.dir}{(character) if project is TRUE, name of the folder containing folders in which variables of
projection scenarios are placed.}

\item{M.var.dir}{(character) name of the forlder containing folders in which calibration environmental
datasets are placed.}

\item{sets.var}{(character) value or vector with the name(s) of the sets of variables
from G.var.dir and M.var.dir that are going to be compared to create the MOP(s).}

\item{out.mop}{(character) name of the folder to which MOP results will be written.}

\item{percent}{(numeric) percetage of values sampled from the calibration region to calculate the MOP.}

\item{comp.each}{(numeric) compute distance matrix for a each fixed number of rows (default 2000).}

\item{parallel}{(logical) option to be passed to the \code{\link{kuenm_mop}} function (for each independent
MOP analyses). If TRUE, calculations will be performed in parallel using the available cores of the
computer. This will demand more RAM and almost full use of the CPU; hence, its use is more
recommended in high-performance computers. Using this option will speed up the analyses.
Default = FALSE}
}
\value{
A folder containing one or multiple mobility-oriented parity raster layers depending on
how many projection areas or scenarios are considered. This results will be organized by the
different sets of variables chosen for creating final models. Values of 0 in resultant rasters
represent strict extrapolation.
}
\description{
kuenm_mmop calculates mobility-oriented parity (MOP) layers by
comparing environmental values between the calibration area and multiple areas or
scenarios to which ecological niche models are transferred.
}
\details{
This function can be used after selection of parameters that produce the best
models (when chosen sets of variables are known), or after producing final models
with the function \code{\link{kuenm_mod}}. In a MOP layer, areas of strict extrapolation
are excluded and other values represent how similar areas or scenarios are to
environmental conditions in the calibration area. MOP is calculated following Owens et al.
(2013; \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011}).
